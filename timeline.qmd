## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)

timeline_df <- read.csv("timeline.csv") |> mutate(date = mdy(date))
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false

# stealing from https://www.r4photobiology.info/galleries/plot-timeline.html
# future ref: if doing multiple timelines on one image, better to do grob 
# by grob and add. Otherwise maybe just do separate images

timeline_df |>
  ggplot(aes(y = timeline, x = date, fill = project, color = project,
             label = paste0(event |>str_wrap(width=25) ,"\n",
                            format(date, "%b %d")))
         ) + 
  geom_line(group=1, color = "black") + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_label_repel(seed = 123,
                  #direction = "y", # debatable -- does look better with flex on horizontal axis
                  point.padding = .5,
                  box.padding = .5,
                  max.overlaps = 20,
                  size = 3,
                  color = "black")  +
  scale_x_date(name = "",date_breaks = "3 months", 
               limits = c(mdy("08/01/2024","02/01/2026"))) + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(legend.position = "top",
        axis.text.y = element_blank() ) 
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
